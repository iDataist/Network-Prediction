# Network Prediction
This project predicted the salary, position, and future connections of the employees of a company using their logs of email exchanges. The findings are presented in [Network_Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/Network-Prediction/blob/master/Network_Prediction.ipynb). 

The raw data is stored in [email_prediction.txt](https://github.com/iDataist/Network-Prediction/blob/master/email_prediction.txt), and [future_connections](https://github.com/iDataist/Network-Prediction/blob/master/Future_Connections.csv). The first file is a company's email network where each node corresponds to a person at the company, and each edge indicates that at least one email has been sent between two people. The network also contains the node attributes `Department` and `ManagementSalary`. `Department` indicates the department in the company which the person belongs to, and `ManagementSalary` indicates whether that person is receiving a management position salary. The second file has future connections information. The index is a tuple indicating a pair of nodes that currently do not have a connection, and the `Future Connection` column indicates if an edge between those two nodes will exist in the future, where a value of 1.0 indicates a future connection.
